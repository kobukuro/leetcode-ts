# LeetCode TypeScript Solutions

A collection of LeetCode problem solutions implemented in TypeScript with detailed complexity analysis and test coverage.

## Features

- **Type-Safe Solutions**: All solutions written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled
- **Testing**: Full Jest test coverage for all solutions
- **Complexity Analysis**: Detailed time and space complexity documentation for each solution
- **Organized Structure**: Problems organized by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- **Tagged Solutions**: Solutions tagged with relevant data structures and algorithms

## Project Structure

```
leetcode-ts/
├── src/problems/
│   ├── easy/           # Easy difficulty problems
│   ├── medium/         # Medium difficulty problems (directory will be created when the first medium problem is solved)
│   └── hard/           # Hard difficulty problems
└── docs/               # Detailed problem lists
```

Each problem follows this structure:
```
{difficulty}/{number}-{problem-name}/
├── solution.ts         # Solution implementation
└── solution.test.ts    # Test cases
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
