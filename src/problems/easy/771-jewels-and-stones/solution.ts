/**
 * Time complexity: O(J + S)
 * Breakdown:
 * - Set creation: set(jewels) creates a set from the jewels string
 *   - This operation iterates through all J characters in the jewels string
 *   - Each character insertion into the set takes O(1) average time
 *   - Total: O(J)
 * - Main loop: Iterates through each character in the stones string of length S
 *   - Each in operation on the set takes O(1) average time for lookup
 *   - Total: O(S)
 * - Overall: O(J) + O(S) = O(J + S)
 * Where J is the length of the jewels string and S is the length of the stones string.
 *
 * Space complexity: O(J)
 * Breakdown:
 * - Set storage: The jewelTypes set stores at most J unique characters from the jewels string
 *   - In the worst case, all characters in jewels are unique, requiring O(J) space
 * - Other variables: res uses O(1) constant space
 * - Overall: O(J)
